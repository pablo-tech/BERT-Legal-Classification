Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 719 (2d Cir.2002). For substantially the reasons set forth in the District Court's Opinion and Order entered March 21, 2013, we agree that Widomski has not produced evidence that would permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against him was a pretext for retaliation. Contarino's good faith belief that Widomski fabricated two assignments constitutes a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for bringing a disciplinary action against him. The burden having shifted back to Widomski to provide competent evidence of pretext, Widomski fails to raise a genuine factual dispute as to whether this explanation is false or otherwise pretextual. See Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 42 (2d Cir.2000). CONCLUSION We have considered Widomski's remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.\"]"
